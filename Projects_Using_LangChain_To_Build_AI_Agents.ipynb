On the other hand, other types of generative AI have been used to synthesize\\nimages and other types of data for research and practical purposes, which have resolved some\\nethical issues and exposed other ethical issues,4,5 but such technology is less often the focus\\nof ongoing ethical discussions. Here we highlight gaps in current ethical discussions of\\ngenerative AI via a systematic scoping review of relevant existing research in healthcare, and\\nreduce the gaps by proposing an ethics checklist for comprehensive assessment and\\ntransparent documentation of ethical discussions in generative AI development. While the\\nchecklist can be readily integrated into the current peer review and publication system to\\nenhance generative AI research, it may also be used in broader settings to disclose ethicsrelated considerations in generative AI-powered products (or real-life applications of such\\nproducts) to help users establish reasonable trust in their capabilities.\\n\\nCurrent ethical discussions on generative AI in healthcare\\nWe conducted a systematic scoping review to analyse current ethical discussions on\\ngenerative AI in healthcare. Our search in four major academic research databases for\\nrelevant publications from January 2013 to July 2023 yielded 2859 articles (see Methods for\\ndetailed search strategy and Supplementary Figure S1 for the PRISMA flow diagram), of\\nwhich 193 articles were included for analysis based on application data modality (text, image,\\nor structured data), ethical issues discussed, generative AI involved, and whether generative\\nAI causes or offers technical solutions for issues raised.\\n\\nGenerative AI for text data-based healthcare\\nForty-one of the 193 articles discussed ethical considerations pertaining to generative AI\\napplications for text data, with 20 articles describing methodological developments or\\napplications of generative AI and the other 21 articles describing review-type works on this\\ntopic. Although some of these review-type articles used the general term “generative AI”, the\\nmain body and supporting evidence focused on LLMs. Twenty-nine articles had in-depth\\ndiscussions on ethical issues, whereas the other 12 articles only briefly touched on some\\nethical aspects.\\nAmong the 41 articles, 29 articles focused on discussing ethical issues caused by LLMs (and\\nspecifically by GPT in 16 of the articles), covering a wide range of application scenarios and\\nconsidered the application of all 10 ethical principles identified in the review (see Figure 1),\\nas well as other less discussed concerns such as human-AI interaction, and the rights of\\nLLMs to be considered as co-authors in scientific papers. One paper only commented briefly\\non the need for ethical considerations in LLMs and is summarised in the “Others” category.\\nAlthough all ethical principles are equally important, some are discussed more often than\\nothers, e.g., non-maleficence (also referred to in the literature as ‘benevolence’), equity, and\\nprivacy.\\nFifteen of the 41 articles aimed to resolve some existing ethical issues (for example,\\nconfidentiality of medical data) by using LLMs and other generative AI (e.g., GAN,\\nautoencoder or diffusion), such as, to reduce privacy concerns by generating synthetic\\nmedical text, to reduce disparity by providing accessible services and assistance, to detect\\nhealth-related misinformation, to generate trusted content, and to improve accountability or\\ntransparency over existing approaches. While most articles focused on either identifying\\nethical issues caused by generative AI or proposing generative AI-based solutions, three\\narticles discussed both to provide a more balanced perspective.\\n\\nGenerative AI for image and structured data-based healthcare\\nUnlike the diverse application scenarios of generative AI based on text data, for image and\\nstructured data, this use of generative AI focuses on data synthesis and encryption. Hence the\\nmajority of articles discussed the methodological developments of generative AI as giving\\nrise to a more distinctive and focused set of ethical issues.\\n5\\nNotably, of the 98 articles on image data and 58 articles on structured data, more than half\\n(n=63 for image data and n=33 for structured data) only mentioned ethical considerations as a\\nbrief motivation for methodological developments or as a general discussion point. The rest\\nincluded more in-depth discussions or evaluations of ethical issues. Among these 155 articles\\n(as one article covered multiple modalities), 11 articles were review-type work, where 10\\narticles reviewed methods that mentioned one or two ethical perspectives, and only one\\narticle24 discussed detailed ethical concerns on generative AI applications.\\nResolving privacy issues was the main aim of articles for these two data modalities (n=74 for\\nimage data and n=50 for structured data; see Figure 1), predominantly by generating synthetic\\ndata using GAN. Eight articles on image data and 9 articles on structured data used\\ngenerative AI to reduce bias, e.g., by synthesizing data for under-represented subgroups in\\nexisting databases. For both data modalities, we did not see explicit discussions on resolving\\nautonomy, integrity, or morality issues using generative AI, and for structured data the articles\\nadditionally lacked discussions on trust or transparency.\\nOnly 11 articles for image data selectively discussed some ethical issues that generative AI\\ncan give rise to, without specific discussions regarding autonomy, integrity, or morality. For\\nstructured data, only 4 articles discussed equity, privacy, or data security issues caused by\\ngenerative AI. Only two articles on structured data included both the cause and resolving\\nperspectives by discussing ethical issues that may arise from limitations of methods\\nproposed, specifically bias induced when synthesizing data in order to resolve privacy issues.\\n\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),\n",

While public attention often focuses on the risks, there remains a critical gap in how these ethical issues are systematically identified, discussed, and resolved beyond evolving regulations. A recent systematic review highlights these gaps and proposes a practical \"ethics checklist\" designed to enhance the responsible development and deployment of generative AI in healthcare.\\n\\n**Current Landscape and Challenges:**\\nOur analysis of existing research (2013-2023) on generative AI in healthcare reveals that while many ethical issues are discussed, the approach is often fragmented.\\n*   **Text-based AI (e.g., LLMs):** Discussions frequently revolve around privacy, equity, and the potential for harm (non-maleficence). Concerns like human-AI interaction and even AI\\'s role as a co-author are emerging. Some applications, however, are also being explored to *resolve* issues, such as generating synthetic data to protect patient privacy or detecting misinformation.\\n*   **Image and Structured Data AI:** For these modalities, generative AI is primarily used for data synthesis and encryption, mainly to address privacy concerns. However, ethical discussions are less comprehensive, often only briefly mentioned as motivations for methodological development. There are notable gaps in explicit discussions regarding autonomy, integrity, morality, trust, and transparency for these applications.\\n\\n**Addressing the Gaps: The Proposed Ethics Checklist**\\nTo bridge these identified gaps, the research proposes a comprehensive \"ethics checklist.\" This tool is designed to:\\n1.  **Systematic Assessment:** Ensure a thorough evaluation of all relevant ethical considerations during the development of generative AI technologies.\\n2.  **Transparent Documentation:** Facilitate clear and consistent recording of ethical discussions and decisions.\\n3.  **Integration:** Be readily incorporated into existing peer review and publication systems to elevate the ethical rigor of AI research.\\n4.  **User Trust:** Serve as a mechanism for healthcare companies to disclose ethics-related considerations in generative AI-powered products, fostering reasonable trust among users and patients regarding their capabilities.\\n\\n**Pros of Ethics in Generative AI for Healthcare:**\\n*   Generative AI can actively *resolve* existing ethical issues, such as enhancing patient data privacy through synthetic data generation and reducing healthcare disparities by providing accessible services.\\n*   Proactive ethical assessment and transparent documentation build stronger user and patient trust in AI-powered healthcare products and services.\\n*   Structured ethical frameworks, like the proposed checklist, can guide responsible innovation, ensuring that AI development aligns with core healthcare values and principles.\\n\\n**Cons/Challenges of Ethics in Generative AI for Healthcare:**\\n*   Existing ethical guidelines and regulations are often insufficient or still under development, leaving a lack of clear pathways for resolving complex new ethical issues arising from generative AI.\\n*   Generative AI introduces novel and complex ethical dilemmas, including challenges related to human-AI interaction, accountability, and the very concept of AI\\'s role in creative or intellectual contributions.\\n*   Significant gaps persist in current ethical discussions, particularly concerning principles like patient autonomy, data integrity, morality, and comprehensive trust/transparency for AI applications involving image and structured medical data.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--d2b16d9c-0b3f-4e70-bba6-e47686272597-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1738, 'output_tokens': 717, 'total_tokens': 3298}),\n",
